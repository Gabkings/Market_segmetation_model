# Market_segmetation_model
Based on the five types of market segmentation, our model will use the behavioral segmentation to come up with different customer clusters. We will sample market segmentation data that will be based on loyalty and satisfaction. This will help us understand our customers better and see different ways we can improve their shopping experience.
